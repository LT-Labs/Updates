## Details of the changes

### ⌛ Mail with expiration rewards

Now mail rewards can have a expiration time, this means that the rewards won't be claimable after the expiration date, the mail that contains the reward won't be deleted, and a message will appear saying when the reward has expired:

#### Reward not expired

### 🎟️ Supportive rewards are now given in mails

As it was complicated to detect if a supportive reward was given or not, now we can see the reward in the inbox, as well, the reward has a expiration time of 7 days

### 🎁 Gift now have a expiration time of `7 days`

We can't say much about this new feature, just that the gift reward will expire in 7 days.

### 👥 Public mails (mails that are sent to everyone) are back

The mail you received with the changelog was a public mail, but since the growth of Mining Tycoon, sending public mails was impossible to do, now we have re-coded it so the bot doesn't crash while sending a massive amount of mails.

### 🗑️ Delete expired mails, redeem and delete all gift mails, redeem and delete all supportive miner rewards in just a click is now possible

Since having a massive amount of expired mails, redeeming gifts or supportive rewards one by one is just nonsense, we added massive options!

This options will appear in a box below the change page buttons if you have:

- 1 expired mail **or**
- 1 gift mail **or**
- 1 supportive miner reward

#### Deleting expired mails

When you have at least one expired mail, the `Mail Options` box will appear at the bottom with the option of `Delete Expired` and the description of the option will tell you how many mails it'll delete.

Option:

#### Redeeming all gifts

Before, you had to go through each gift and redeem it, now you can do it all in one click

> ℹ️ Doing this won't give the gift back. We recommend to gift someone back first and then click this option*

Option:

Result:

In this case, only one user has gifted us, but if several users had gifted you, you would see the amount of times each user has gifted you.

#### Redeeming all supportive miner rewards

Kind of the same as above, but with the supportive miner rewards. It'll redeem all the rewards and delete the mails.

### 📧 Inbox can be opened from QuickPlay menu

If you don't know what is "QuickPlay menu", it's the menu that appears below of the buttons of the main game (Shovel, Pickaxe, Drill, ...)

Well, now The inbox is now included as an option in that Menu, so you don't have to run /inbox every time you want to open the inbox.

> Please note that by opening the inbox from this button will make the inbox public and everyone can see the mail you are seeing, they can't interact with it.

![button](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009547587180839035/1141111491454582934/image.png)

as well, after you close the inbox, or it closes automatically, the QuickPlay menu will appear.
