# Details of the changes

## üåê Translations have arrived to Mining Tycoon!
Yes, you read it right. Mining tycoon now supports languages!
##### Available languages
 - English
 - Spanish (Espa√±ol)

##### How it works?
 Mining tycoon can use your Discord Language, for example, if you have discord set in `Spanish (Spain)`, mining tycoon's slash commands, and the messages of it will be according to that language.
 Anyways, you can change Mining tycoon language to work separated from your discord language with `/language` command.

*Note: Slash commands in the menu will always be in the same language as your discord client.*

*Note 2: If your discord language is not supported by mining tycoon, it'll use English as the default language.*

## ‚úâÔ∏è Gifts are now received in `/inbox`
Before, gifts were just added to the user profile, with this update the user gifted can see who sent the gift and when, so you can give that nice gift again üéÅüòâ! 

![inbox](https://i.imgur.com/AdPOpI7.png)

## üéÅ Sending gifts with messages
As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, you see a "I don't have anything to say". What does this mean?
Yes, you choose a message in a list when sending the gift and that message will be sent together to the user gifted.

They are available in all supported languages as well

## üì¶ `/open-all` is now an embed
Do you think the actual message to show what you got from those boxes is nice?
We don't think that, so we changed it to use embeds!

## ‚ô•Ô∏è Added Supportive miners
Supportive miners are now available! A supportive miner is a way to show support for the game development.

## üé´ Scratching amount
*Supportive miner Feature*

We guess you have many scratch cards to open, so we added this feature.
